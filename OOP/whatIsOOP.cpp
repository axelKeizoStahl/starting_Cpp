		OOP stands for object oriented programming
		procedural programming was when you wrote functions that preforms operations on data
		OOP creats objects that contain both the functions and the data
		Reasons to use OOP:
			OOP is faster and easier to execute
			provides clear structure in the code
			helps to make you not repeat yourself
				not repeating code is important principle of coding
				makes it easier to modifiy and debug (sll in one place)
			allows for sully reusable applications, less code, so faster developing times
		
		OOP consitis of Classes and objects
		Classes are sort of like a template and like a struct
		objects are instances of that class, and so all the objects of one class contain the same data and functions
